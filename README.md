#Hyrule Compendium

ToDo:

NEXT GOAL: 

 - SVG Borders, ANIMATED (glyphs borders are random, glyphs fade in and out randomly, change color, change glyph, all random)

 - Fix mobile, it's not looking amazing

 - Fix SVG Sheikah logo (its rough, maybe look into inkscape idk)

 - Jump-to buttons, mostly for mobile the scrolling is crazy

  - Explore different body fonts?

Landing Page:

 - Opening Sheikah logo animation

 - Responsive Website & Tablet Layout

 - Mobile Layout

 - Master Mode Toggle with color scheme change

 - Top and bottom borders (Sheikah slate borders?)

Search:
 
 - Layouts and styles for now

 - Better search (multiple results, search by term insead of just name)

All Entries:

 - Minimal mode, just display name and picture, clicking pulls up full card

 - Loading animation (set interval before api call, stop it after cards are generated)
