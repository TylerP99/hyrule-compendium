#Hyrule Compendium

ToDo:

NEXT GOAL: 

 - Loading animation during api call, starting with all entries
   (My solution is below, on page load we set interval to start loading animation, after the buttons are initialized, stop the interval)

Landing Page:

 - Opening Sheikah logo animation

 - Responsive Website & Tablet Layout

 - Mobile Layout

 - Master Mode Toggle with color scheme change

 - Top and bottom borders (Sheikah slate borders?)

Search:
 
 - Layouts and styles for now

 - Better search (multiple results, search by term insead of just name)

All Entries:

 - Minimal mode, just display name and picture, clicking pulls up full card

 - Loading animation (set interval before api call, stop it after cards are generated)
